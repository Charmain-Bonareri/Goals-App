/*
-We moved the logic from the app component to the goal component

The ngIf commands simply checks if a condition is met and performs an action based on that condition.
on line 8, we check if the length of the goals array is more than 5, then display the text in the paragraph.

- ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook. It is called each time the component is created. We use it to put complex initialization logic that we
want for the component.

-we moved the template logic from app.html to goal component.
